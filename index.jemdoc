= About me
I am currently an assistant professor in the School of Mathematical Sciences at PKU.  Previously, I was a postdoc at the [https://www.pacm.princeton.edu/ Program in Applied and Computational Mathematics (PACM)] of [https://www.princeton.edu/ Princeton University]. 
My research interests are broadly in machine learning theory and applying machine learning to solve scientific computing problems. 

I completed my Ph.D. in computational mathematics at [https://www.pku.edu.cn/ PKU] in 2018, advised by [https://web.math.princeton.edu/~weinan/ Prof. Weinan E]. Before that, I received the B.S. degree in pure mathematics from [https://www.nankai.edu.cn/ Nankai University] in 2012.
