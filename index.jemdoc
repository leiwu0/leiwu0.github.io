= About me

I am a postdoc at the [https://www.pacm.princeton.edu/ Program in Applied and Computational Mathematics (PACM)] at [https://www.princeton.edu/ Princeton University]. My research interest are broadly in machine learning theory and its applications in solving scientific problems. 

I completed my Ph.D. in Computational Mathematics from [http://www.math.pku.edu.cn/ School of Mathematical Science] of [https://www.pku.edu.cn/ Peking University] in 2018, advised by [https://web.math.princeton.edu/~weinan/ Prof. Weinan E]. Before that, I received the B.S. degree in pure mathematics from [https://www.nankai.edu.cn/ Nankai University] in 2012.
