== About Me
I am  currently an Assistant Professor in the [https://www.math.pku.edu.cn School of Mathematical Sciences] and  [https://cmlr.pku.edu.cn Center for Machine Learning Research] at [https://www.pku.edu.cn/ Peking University]. 

Previously, I was a postdoc in PACM  at  Princeton University and in the Wharton Statistics and Data Science Department at the University of Pennsylvania.  I completed my Ph.D. in computational mathematics at Peking University in 2018, advised by  Prof. Weinan E. I received my B.S. degree in  mathematics from  Nankai University in 2012. 


My research aims to understand the mechanisms behind the success of deep learning, with a particular focus on:

- The approximation and representation power of neural networks

- The dynamical behavior of popular optimization algorithms such as SGD and Adam

- Emergent phenomena in the training of large language models (LLMs)

== Recruiting
We are actively seeking self-motivated postdocs, PhD students and interns to join our team. If you are interested in collaborating with me, please send an email to me with your CV and transcript as well as a brief description of your research interests.
